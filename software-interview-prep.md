## Algorithms

### Tree traversal
- Pre-order traversal
- In-order traversal
- Post-order traversal
- Breadth first search
- Depth first search
**Know how to do recursively and iteratively**
**Use bfs to find nearest node to match some criteria**

### Binary search
- Traverse tree to look for some node

### Data structures to represent a tree
- Left & right
- A node with an array of children nodes

### Recursion
- Commonly recursive functions call helper functions
- Think about the base case
- Not used much in tech because it is limited to stack space
- Every recursive function can be converted into iterative (stacks or queues)
